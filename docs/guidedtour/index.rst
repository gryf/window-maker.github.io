Foreword
--------

This tutorial is intended to help Window Maker users gain knowledge about the
many excellent features of this window manager. The official Users Guide is
worth reading. It can be reached from the `Window Maker site </docs/guide_toc.html>`_. Other guides, tutorials and tips can be found at
various sites on the internet. An internet search for "Window Maker guide
how-to" might provide additional worthwhile information.

This guided tour is NOT supposed to be a README, INSTALL or FAQ. These are
worth reading, or more accurately, they should be considered COMPULSORY
reading.

The information in the guided tour is based upon Window Maker version 0.95.3.
Check your version by opening WPrefs.app (the Window Maker Preferences tool).
The version number is shown in the initial WPrefs window just below the "Window
Maker Preferences" title. You may also run the command "*wmaker --version*" in
a terminal (without the quotation marks). This command returns the installed
version number of Window Maker.

A special word of thanks
------------------------

The original Window Maker Guided Tour site was created and maintained for many
years by Georges Tarbouriech. Where possible, I have retained his original
work - including the layout and structure of the pages, the descriptions of
Window Maker features, and even some of his original graphics. I want these
pages to be up-to-date, but I also want them to be (as much as possible) a
continuation of Georges' work. *Thank you, Georges*.  (Having said that,
anything you find in error is without question my fault - so don't blame
Georges for any mistakes!) If you find an error, have a suggestion, or wish to
make a comment, you may contact me by email at
*bnance&lt;atsigngoeshere&gt;uu.edu*.

This tour will attempt to follow Window Maker development, but not
every update can be taken into account.  In other words, this
tour can help you learn the basics, but does not pretend to provide all
of the detail or all of the latest information available in the
official README, INSTALL and FAQ documents provided by Window Maker
developers and maintainers.
